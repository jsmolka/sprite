# sprite
A Game Boy emulator written in [drizzle](https://github.com/jsmolka/drizzle).

## Why
This emulator serves as the ultimate stress test for the programming language. It implements most components of the system with reasonable accuracy and runs at native speed. There is no sound or saves, and the cartridge types are limited to MBC0, MBC1, and MBC3.

## Usage
Download the latest version of [drizzle-sdl](https://github.com/jsmolka/drizzle/releases) for your system and run `drizzle sprite.dz <rom>`.

## Binaries
Binaries for Windows, Linux and macOS are available as [nightly](https://nightly.link/jsmolka/sprite/workflows/build/master) and [release](https://github.com/jsmolka/sprite/releases) builds.

## Build
Detailed build instructions can be found [here](BUILD.md).
